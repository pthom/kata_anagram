# Scaffold / Cmake scaffold for TDD devel lab 
This is a scaffold for a TDD devel lab in C++ 11.

2 targets are available: lab (main) and lab_test (unit tests)

### Notes about doctest (https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)
- header only test library
- the tests can be written "in-place" (in the same cpp file as the tested function)
- tutorial : https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/tutorial.md
